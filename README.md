Car Price Prediction Model using ML Decision Tree Regressor in Python
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of a car based on various features such as car length, width, horsepower, engine size, etc. The model uses the decision tree regressor algorithm to predict the car prices based on the given dataset.

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from the internet and contains the following columns:

car_ID
symboling
CarName
fueltype
aspiration
doornumber
carbody
drivewheel
enginelocation
wheelbase
carlength
carwidth
carheight
curbweight
enginetype
cylindernumber
enginesize
fuelsystem
boreratio
stroke
compressionratio
horsepower
peakrpm
citympg
highwaympg
price
The model is built using Python programming language for machine learning. The project also includes the use of pandas library for data manipulation and seaborn library for data visualization.

The project will be hosted on GitHub and will include the following files:

README.md: Project description file.
car_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the model development and analysis.
car_data.csv: Dataset file used in the project.
requirements.txt: File containing the list of required libraries to run the code.
The project will be open-source and available for contribution from the community. The code will be well-documented with comments to help the readers understand the process of model development and analysis.

The final model will be evaluated based on various metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared value. The evaluation will be performed using cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness.

The project will be useful for car dealerships, car buyers, and insurance companies to predict the prices of cars accurately based on the given features.
